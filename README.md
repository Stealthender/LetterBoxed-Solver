# LetterBoxed Solver
A C# program to solve letterboxed, this was a very fun challenge thinking of ways to solve the puzzle. One thing I will do is change the solve in future too allow 3 word solutions to be shown. Through testing I've yet to find a situation where a 2 word answer hasn't been possible
